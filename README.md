# Face-Anti-Spoofing
Facial recognition is used everywhere for biometric authentication. But such facial recognition systems are prone to spoofing attacks such as presentation attacks. In which an imposter presents the system with a photograph of the person's actual face. In this project, we develop a CNN based face anti-spoofing model that can detect a spoofed image with high accuracy.
